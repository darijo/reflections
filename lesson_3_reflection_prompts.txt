When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When adding a new feature, on GitHub should have commits when the feature is complete,
not doing commit every time part of feature is completed (eventually this will be part of branch)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are different parts of same project in one repository. Clones are exact copies of repository, while
forks are essential the same as clone but these are copies of repository on GitHub, and
are referenced appropriately.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To have the latest changes in repository. It lowers the chance of conflicts
