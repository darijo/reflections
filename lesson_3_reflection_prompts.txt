When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When adding a new feature, on GitHub should have commits when the feature is complete,
not doing commit every time part of feature is completed (eventually this will be part of branch)
